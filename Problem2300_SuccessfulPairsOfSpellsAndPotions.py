Problem 2300: Successful Pairs of Spells and Potions
URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/successful-pairs-of-spells-and-potions/
Runtime: 1273 ms, Beat: 83.57%

Description:
You are given two positive integer arrays spells and potions, of length n and m respectively, where spells[i] represents
the strength of the ith spell and potions[j] represents the strength of the jth potion. You are also given an integer
success. A spell and potion pair is considered successful if the product of their strengths is at least success. Return
an integer array pairs of length n where pairs[i] is the number of potions that will form a successful pair
with the ith spell.

Example:
Input: spells = [5,1,3], potions = [1,2,3,4,5], success = 7
Output: [4,0,3]
Explanation:
- 0th spell: 5 * [1,2,3,4,5] = [5,10,15,20,25]. 4 pairs are successful.
- 1st spell: 1 * [1,2,3,4,5] = [1,2,3,4,5]. 0 pairs are successful.
- 2nd spell: 3 * [1,2,3,4,5] = [3,6,9,12,15]. 3 pairs are successful.
Thus, [4,0,3] is returned.
