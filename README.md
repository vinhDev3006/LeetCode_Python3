# LeetCode_Python3
This repository has been created for the purpose of solving various coding problems found on the LeetCode platform. Each problem presents a unique challenge, and there are often multiple ways to arrive at a solution. By practicing and exploring different approaches, I hope to expand my knowledge and strengthen my problem-solving skills.

It is worth noting that many of these problems are used as technical interview questions by top technology companies. Therefore, the ability to solve them demonstrates not only proficiency in coding, but also the potential to succeed in a high-pressure, competitive environment.

Through this repository, I aim to not only sharpen my own skills, but also provide a helpful resource for others looking to improve their problem-solving abilities. Whether you are a seasoned programmer or just starting out, I hope that you find value in the solutions presented here.
